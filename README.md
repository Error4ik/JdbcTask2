# JdbcTask2

Task 2. Stored Procedure

Take the existing (or write from zero) JDBC solution with a few CRUD operations 
and more complex SQL (for simple report generation) and migrate it to stored procedures.*

1.	Write SQL â€“ script to create those stored procedures with Java style parameters 
      and specific external names. **

2.	Write a test which drops all stored procedures and creates a few of them via Java code

3.	Also, provide the script to print out all stored procedure in your database and dropping
      them for test purposes, for example.

4.	Check that the application works properly, all test are green and so on.

5.	Compare the performance of two solution; explain to your mentor the benefits or disadvantages
      of storage procedure usage for the taken application.

* 3-5 tables with CRUD operations and two complex SELECTS can be enough.
  ** Use MySQL or PostgreSQL or Oracle
